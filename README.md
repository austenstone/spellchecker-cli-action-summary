Adding mispeled stuff

# Action
An [Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) that creates job summaries, status checks, and issues for markdown spelling errors reported by [tbroadley/spellchecker-cli](https://github.com/tbroadley/spellchecker-cli).

## Issue & Job Summary
Get a table of all the misspelled words with suggested fixes and links directly to the file/line. The job summary is always created and the issue summary is created if the job is not of event type `push` or `pull_request`. The issue summary contains all misspelled words but the job summary only contains results from the files that have changed if the event is of type `push` or `pull_request`.

## Status Checks
Status checks will be reported if the event is of type `pull_request`.
### Annotations
The status checks contain inline annotations that will appear in the files changed view of the pull request. See [Getting started with the Checks API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api).

## Usage
Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/seat-count.yml`). See [Creating a Workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).
